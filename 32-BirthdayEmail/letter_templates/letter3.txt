Wishing you a happy birthday, [NAME]!

You are the friend who defines true friendship. You have always been there with me, extending the support and affection I needed. When you are with me, I feel the happiest and the strongest because you are the strongest pillar for me. The adoration you see in my eyes is only for you, my friend, because Iâ€™m grateful to have you in my life.
