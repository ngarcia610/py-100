Happy birthday dear, [NAME]!

Sometimes I feel that had you not been there in my life, it would have been such a boring and dull life. You are the cheese to my pizza, maple syrup to my pancake, and butter to my toast because I cannot imagine my life without you. Cheers to all the amazing memories we have created together! I cannot wait to make many more.
