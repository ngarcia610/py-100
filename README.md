## Description
Welcome to the 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp, the only course you need to learn to code with Python. With over 500,000 5 STAR reviews and a 4.8 average, my courses are some of the HIGHEST RATED courses in the history of Udemy!  

100 days, 1 hour per day, learn to build 1 project per day, this is how you master Python.

At 60+ hours, this Python course is without a doubt the most comprehensive Python course available anywhere online. Even if you have zero programming experience, this course will take you from beginner to professional. Here's why:

- The course is taught by the lead instructor at the App Brewery, London's best in-person programming Bootcamp.
- The course has been updated to be 2022 ready and you'll be learning the latest tools and technologies used at large companies such as Apple, Google and Netflix.
- This course doesn't cut any corners, there are beautiful animated explanation videos and tens of real-world projects which you will get to build. e.g. Tinder auto swiper, Snake game, Blog Website, LinkedIn Auto Submit Job Application
- The curriculum was developed over a period of 2 years, with comprehensive student testing and feedback.
- We've taught over 600,000 students how to code and many have gone on to change their lives by becoming professional developers or starting their own tech startup.
- You'll save yourself over $12,000 by enrolling, and still get access to the same teaching materials and learn from the same instructor and curriculum as our in-person programming Bootcamp.
- The course is constantly updated with new content, with new projects and modules determined by students - that's you!
